This repository contains from-scratch implementations of two fundamental machine learning algorithms:

Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) for binary classification

Decision Tree Classifier using Gini impurity

The implementations are written in pure Python with NumPy only, without using scikit-learn or other ML libraries.
